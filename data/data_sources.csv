The dataset is generated using historical data from IBTrACS and resembles present-climate conditions. The data can be used to calculate tropical cyclone risk in all (coastal) regions prone to tropical cyclones. VERSION UPDATE (30 Sept 2020): The Saffir-Simpson category thresholds were wrongly calculated in the previous version, this has now been corrected. VERSION UPDATE (18 March 2021): The old version of STORM contained some duplicate cyclone tracks. These have now been removed. VERSION UPDATE (22 July 2022): The last version accidentally still had the old wrong categories ... This version has the right categories AND the duplicates removed! :-)","2019-11-20","2025-10-29 10:49:39","2025-10-29 10:51:35","2025-10-29 10:49:39","","","","","","","","","","","","4TU.ResearchData","","en","CC0","","","","figshare.com","","","","C:\Users\ggenelot\Zotero\storage\X69UAYF5\4.html","","","/unread; inbox","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","","","","","","","",""
